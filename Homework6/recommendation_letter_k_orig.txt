To whom it may concern,
I am ^_^ to present this ╰(▔∀▔)╯ recommendation for my CS5001 class.
I am (#^.^#) and (-"-) that I would not reach you in time.
I think my brother's =^._.^=∫ made me `(๑△๑)`* again. Almost like the "dog ate my homework" (you can Almost
see me (^_-) at you now!)
Anyway, this is a fine group of students. It does my (*♡▽♡*) good to see them progress so fast!
I am ^_^ to provide any details as you need them.
Best,
Dr. Bagley
