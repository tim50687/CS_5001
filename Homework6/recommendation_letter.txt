To whom it may concern,
I am happy to present this cool recommendation for my CS5001 class.
I am embarrassed and worried that I would not reach you in time.
I think my brother's cat made me sick again. Almost like the "dog ate my homework" (you can Almost
see me wink at you now!)
Anyway, this is a fine group of students. It does my heart good to see them progress so fast!
I am happy to provide any details as you need them.
Best,
Dr. Bagley
