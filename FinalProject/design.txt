To do 
** left hand side tile, it won't work


1. gameboard class
create a layout of the gameboard, to store the layout data
create a class for tile while add tile on the gameboard


2. 
create a turtle class inherit from Gameboard class to draw

add_tile
need to store every tile coordinate
3. tile class 

create click function 
use Position system :D . to keep track of the blank tile coordinate
-- switch the image 
-- remember the blank tile 
## nake click class would be more efficient

4. After finish the button function, 
do the logic for winning and losing the game 
- i. count the user moves

5. after finish win/ lost logic 
------------------
6. save the winner count and name to a file and show on the leader (update)
-> to do: show on the leader board based on different pupzzle -- done

7. fix the bug and exception handling and clean the code 


First part - do the splash screeen and anything before game

1. Splash Screen before gameplay start, should linger 3-4 seconds
2. let user input their name to my game through pop-up window
3. user should allowed to selecte the number to my game, 5 - 200, otherwise, return error

*** able to recognize unsolvable puzzle ***

Secondd part ddo the logic on the tile 
4. only Tiles which next to the blank can be moved ( Switch with the blank) 
   should updates the number of moves.
5. If click the tiles not adjacent to a blank, nothing happens, 
6. less than max moves, user win, otherwise user lose the game, in either case, result should be shown.

third part  do the button function 
7. reset button - cheat sheet, but the program doesn't end. 
8. user can load a different puzzle from the file using load button. if changed, move count reset to 0 
9. If user attemps to load a non-exist or malformed data, your program should display error message,
   noticed that missing file are recovable errors that should not crash your system.
10. my program should log any error to error file called 5001_puzzle.err. 
11. Player can use quit button to exit the game.


## other information 
1. User must use mouse to play game except entering name and load different puzzle, and enter the number of moves/
2. u are not allowed to used tkinter, only import turtle
3.
